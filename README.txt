      Simulating Bianchi induced temperature fluctuations in 
       CMB maps when incorporating a cosmological constant
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
     This package provides functionality to support the simulation of
     Bianchi Type VIIh induced temperature fluctuations in CMB maps
     of a universe with shear and rotation.  The implementation is
     based on the solutions to the Bianchi models derived by 
     Anthony Lasenby (not yet published) which incorporate a dark
     energy component.

REFERENCE
     This implementation is based on the solutions to the Bianchi
     models derived by Anthony Lasenby when incorporating a dark
     energy component.  This work is not yet published and is still to
     appear.  Nevertheless, we make our implementation of these
     solutions available in this package.  If you use the code to
     produce published works please reference the download site
